## Overview

This tutorial shows you how to deploy an elastic EDA computing cluster on AWS based on the IBM Spectrum LSF workload and resource management software and run an EDA logic verification workload within the environment. The deployed environment installs and configures the LSF software that you provide, using your licenses, and supplies the necessary EDA software and design data to run an example EDA verification workload on the AWS Cloud. Using standard LSF commands, you will be able to submit front-end verification workload into the queue and observe as LSF dynamically adds and removes compute resources as the jobs flow through the system.

This tutorial is for IT, CAD, and design engineers who are interested in running EDA workloads in the cloud using IBM's Spectrum LSF.

### Workshop Architecture

This environment deploys into an existing virtual private cloud (VPC) and builds the following EDA computing environment in the AWS Cloud.

The deployed cloud infrastructure consists of:

* A Linux login/submission host to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) and graphical remote desktop access to the environment.

* An LSF master running IBM Spectrum LSF with the Resource Connector feature enabled

* Amazon EC2 compute instances that are dynamically provisioned by LSF

* An Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system for share file storage.

## Deploy the environment

### Step 1. Sign in to your AWS account

1. Sign into the AWS account provided to you for this workshop.

### Step 2. Upload LSF Software Packages and Entitlement File

1. Create a new S3 bucket in the workshop account.
1. Upload the two required LSF software packages and the LSF entitlement file into the new S3 bucket.

### Step 3. Subscribe to the Required AMIs

This workshop requires a subscription to the following Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in AWS Marketplace. AMIs are images that are used to boot the instances (virtual servers) in AWS. They also contain software required to run the workshop.  There is no additional cost to use these AMIs.

* **Rocky Linux 8 (Official)**. This is the official Rocky Linux 8 image.

Be sure you are logged into the workshop AWS account, and follow these instructions to subscribe:

1. Open the page for the [Rocky Linux 8 (Official)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-2otariyxb3mqu) AMI in AWS Marketplace, and then choose **Continue to Subscribe**.

1. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose **Accept Terms**. You will get a confirmation page, and an email confirmation will be sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the [AWS Marketplace documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470).

1. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. **Do not** click **Continue to Launch**; the workshop CloudFormation templates will deploy the AMI for you.


1. Verify the subscriptions in the [Marketplace dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/home) within the AWS Console.
    * Click on **Manage subscriptions** to confirm that the subscription is active in your account.

### Step 4. Launch the Cluster

**Note** The instructions in this section reflect the new version of the AWS CloudFormation console. If youâ€™re using the original console, some of the user interface elements might be different.   You can switch to the new console by selecting **New console** from the **CloudFormation** menu.

1. Click The **Deploy to AWS** button below to start the CloudFormation deployment process. The link will take you to the AWS CloudFormation console with the path to the deployment template preloaded.

    [![Launch Stack](../../../shared/images/deploy_to_aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=aws-eda-lsf-workshop&templateURL=https://aws-eda-workshop-files.s3.amazonaws.com/workshops/eda-workshop-lsf/templates/eda-lsf-simple-workshop.yaml)

    The cluster infrastructure is deployed in the **US East (N. Virginia)** AWS Region by default.

1. In the **Specify template** section of the **Create stack** page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose **Next**.

1. On the **Specify stack details** page, provide values for the following parameters in the table below. For all other parameters, it is recommended that you keep the default settings.

    |Parameter|Notes|

    When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose **Next**.

1. On the **Configure stack options** page, you can specify [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html) (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack.  We recommend setting **key** to `env` and **value** to `aws-lsf-eda-workshop` or something similar.  This will help to identify resources created by this tutorial. When you're done, click **Add tag**.

1. Under **Stack creation options**, disable **Rollback on failure**. This will leave the resources up for debug in case an error occurs during the provisioning process. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the stack details. Click the **Previous** button at the bottom of the page if you need to return to previous pages to make changes.  Under **Capabilities** at the very bottom, select the check box to acknowledge that the template will create IAM resources.

1. Choose **Create stack** to deploy the stack. Stack creation will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

1. Monitor the status of the stack. When the status is **CREATE\_COMPLETE**, the cluster is ready.

1. Use the URLs displayed in the **Outputs** tab for the stack to view the resources that were created.

### Step 5. Log into the cluster

1. Log into the login/remote desktop server with the DCV client.

    1. In the CloudFormation console, click on the **aws-eda-lsf-workshop** stack and choose the **Outputs** tab.
    1. Copy the IP:port in the **Value** column for the **LoginServerRemoteDesktop**.  This is the public IP of the login server that was deployed by the CloudFormation stack.
    1. Launch the DCV client and paste the IP into the server field. Click **Connect** and then **Proceed**.  
    1. Enter the DCV username and password you provided in **Step 3** above in the credentials fields.
    1. Next, you should see a clock with a blue screen.  Click on it, enter your DCV password once again, and click the **Unlock** button.
    1. Close the **Getting Started** window to reveal the GNOME desktop.

1. Open a new terminal and run the `lsid` command to verify that LSF installed properly and is running.  You should see output similar to the following:

    ```text
